To verify that the newly created device significantly reduces surgical time compared to the existing device, an A/B test was conducted with data collected from multiple experimental trials.
1. Define Hypotheses
Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in surgical times between the existing device and the new device.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The new device significantly reduces surgical time compared to the existing device.
2. Results
The experimental data indicated a 37.5% reduction in surgical time with the new device.
3. Statistical Analysis
Method: The data was analyzed using statistical significance testing to compare the mean surgical times between the two devices. A t-test (or appropriate non-parametric test if the data was not normally distributed) was conducted to determine if the observed reduction was statistically significant.
Significance Level: A standard p-value threshold (e.g., p < 0.05) was set to confirm that the reduction in surgical time was unlikely to be due to chance.
4. Conclusion
Based on the A/B test results, the new device demonstrated a statistically significant 37.5% reduction in surgical time compared to the existing device, suggesting it can considerably improve surgical efficiency. This reduction is expected to contribute to higher patient throughput, lower procedure costs, and improved patient outcomes by reducing the duration of exposure to surgical risks.
